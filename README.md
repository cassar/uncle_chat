# Chat App

## Description
A chat application to keep in touch with my nieces.

## Things to do.

### Major

- Add profile to add friends.
- Have a params code to get to chat 'entrance'.

### Minor

- Switch to inline styling of comments.
- Add background colour for comments.
- Make the chat window start from the bottom and update to the bottom.
- Add persistence to friend comment styling.
- Options at the top need to be hidden if no one is logged in.

## Issues

- I can't put code in a tag, call a method in the controller and expect it to work.
