# Chat App

## Description
A chat application to keep in touch with my nieces.

## Things to do.

### Major

- Have a params code to get to chat 'entrance'.
- Localise a group of friends to a user.

### Minor

- Switch to inline styling of comments.
- Add background colour for comments.
- Make the chat window start from the bottom and update to the bottom.
- Add persistence to friend comment styling.
- Options at the top need to be hidden if no one is logged in.
- Make name entry case insensitive.
- Be able to delete friends. (but what about the comments that they have made?)
- Add dashboard to user dropdown.
- Only show the last say 20 comments.
- Add placeholder on jumbotron landing at entry.
- When a user signs up for the first time...
	- Have them redirected to the dash.
	- Have their first friend auto generated as themselves.

### Very Minor

- Find a way to tile the frinds in the Dash Board so they appear in two columns.
- Find a better way to style the chat UI so inputs looks like FB or WhatsApp.

## Issues

- I can't put code in a tag, call a method in the controller and expect it to work.
